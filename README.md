# Applied Mathematics

Python codebase for Applied mathematics classes


## Development

I set it up to work with Nix Shell. So install Nix and run `nix-shell` in terminal.

In VS Code please set right path to python interpreters, aka from /nix folder.
Otherwise it will not be able to resolve packages. 

## Packages

We use next packages for development in this codebase:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- sympy
